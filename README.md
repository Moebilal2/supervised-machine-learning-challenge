# supervised-machine-learning-challenge
## introduction:
 Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.
loan data will be used to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, comparison will be done between the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier to verify wich one gives better results.
## Solution steps:
- Features and target were specified.
- Data were split to train/test data.
- Scaling was performed using normalization.
- Logistic regression model and random tree model were created.
- Hyperparameter tuning was implemented on both of the models.
- Scores were measured for both models and classification report was issued.
## Results:
 On the train data, Logistic Regression model showed slightly higher score of 0.9942 compared to the score of the Random Forest Classifier 0.9922.
